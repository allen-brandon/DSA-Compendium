    "The Newton-Raphson Root Method (hereon refered to as the Newton Method) is a root-finding algorithm for real functions. In essense it repeatedly calculates the tangent line of a function at a given point, finds the x-intercept of that line, and repeats the process at that new point. This method employs the derivative of a given function to provide increasingly accurate estimations to find a root of a given method."
