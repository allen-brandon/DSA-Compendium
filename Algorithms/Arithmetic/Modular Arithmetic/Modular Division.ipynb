    "\n",
    "* The inverse of a number A, with a given modulus M, is a number B, such that (A * B)%m == 1. This is only possible if A and M are coprime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What's the realistic use-case for a modular multiplicative inverse?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most of the time modular multiplicative inverses are used to divide two numbers, that have been expressed as the remainder of some coprime modulus. If A and B are expressed as remainders of some M, regular arithmetic division cannot calculate (A/B)%M, given A%M and B%M. Rather than attempting regular arithmetic division to find C, one can simply find the multiplicative inverse of B mod(M), and multiply A by this multiplicative inverse. This shows up in number theory, cryptography, and is common in competitive programming. Most importantly it is fundamental to understanding the internals workings of hashing algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Why are only some elements invertible, given a modulus?\n",
    "\n",
    "* An invertible element A, by definition, has a multiplicative inverse B for A given M where (A * B)%M == 1. If A isn't coprime with M, then there is no B for which (A * B)%M == 1. For example, if A == 4, and M == 12, any product with A mod(M) of A will be in the set {4, 8, 0}. The number of invertible elements mod(M) is the amount of numbers below M, that are coprime with M, or ϕ(M).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Why does th Euler's Theorem approach use Euler's Totient Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Euler's Totient function ϕ(M) returns the number of integers up to M that are coprime to M. Euler's Theorem states for any A and M that are coprime, (A<sup>ϕ(M)</sup>)%M == 1. So to find the modular multiplicative inverse of A, we can find A<sup>ϕ(M)-1</sup>, which, when multiplied with A, will be 1. For any A that is coprime with M, the length of the cycle formed by powers of A will be a factor of ϕ(M). When M is prime this ring's length is exactly ϕ(M), or M-1, but with non-prime moduli, there could be multiple rings with differing lengths. Regardless, in order to obtain the last element in the ring(A, M) before 1, one can simply find A<sup>ϕ(M)-1</sup>, without ever deriving the length of the given ring formed by A mod M. The formula for ϕ(M) used above is Euler's product formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Why does the approach using Euler's Theorem have a conditional shorthand for prime moduli?\n",
    "\n",
    "* As described below, a number and its modular multiplicative inverse cycle through finite rings in either direction, given a modulus. The rings are isomorphic to the multiplicative relationship between integers and their multiples in regular arithmetic. For example, the powers of two are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, etc. Taken modulo 3, this maps to 2:2, 4:1, 8:2, 16:1, ... 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1 etc. For non-prime moduli, the amount and lengths of these rings are variable, and depend on the primitive roots of a modulus. But for prime moduli, there is only 1 ring, and its cycle is length M-1. Above, when ϕ(M)-1 is used to find A<sup>-1</sup>, when ϕ(M) == M-1 (e.g. when M is prime), we can simplify ϕ(M)-1 to m-2, and simply take A<sup>M-2</sup> (%M) to find its modular multiplicative inverse, A<sup>-1</sup>."

Just like the multiplicative inverse of a matrix, this is also called the reciprocal.\n",

    "An important part of modular arithmetic is the cyclical nature of its operations. For the hours on a clock (i.e. M = 12), every time you add A to a number, it will wrap around to be somewhere in the range from 0 to 11. There is another cyclical pattern that appears. If you start with any number, and add increments of 3 hours, it will always wrap around to the same number every 4 increments (which corresponds to 12/3= 4). If you add increments of 4 hours, you will reach the same number every 3 increments. If you add increments of 7 hours (which is relatively prime to 12), it will take 12 increments to reach the same number; 7, 2, 9, 4, 11, 6, 1, 8, 3, 10, 5, 0, 7, 2 ... with a length of M/gcd(A, M).\n",

If we took A = 1, B = 7 and M = 11, we would get 1, 7, 5, 2, 3, 10, 4, 6, 9, 8, 1, 7 ... which cycles through 10 numbers. For 8, we get 1, 8, 9, 6, 4, 10, 3, 2, 5, 7, 1, 8, .... which is the same cycle backwards. We can double check that 8 is the modular inverse of 7 by comfirming that (7 * 8)%56 = 1.\n",

Multiplying any X by 7 (mod 11) is the same as dividing any Y that's divisible by 8 (mod 11) by 8, if X%M == Y%M.\n",
