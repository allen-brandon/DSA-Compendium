    "While binary searches are almost always talked about in the context of searching for an element in a sorted sequence, their use extends beyond this context. In fact, potential applications for binary searches show up everywhere. It often takes a keen eye to see where an optimization can be made with a binary search over a linear search. But this has the potential to make code run orders of magnitude faster.\n",

    "Binary searches are notorious for off-by-1 errors and infinite loops. This is because there's a large contrast between the simplicity of the concept of a binary search, and the complications that arise in implementation. As seen in the above templates, there are multiple ways to structure a binary search, that are almost exactly the same as one anohter. For example, you could search for the lowest element >= x, or the highest element <= x. Many people encounter these issues and spend a reliable 10 or 15 minutes tweaking the code until finally they happen upon the correct implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't have to be this way. The key to not wasting time and effort finnicking around with the code is to understand the semantics very specifically. A surface level understanding would be, \"evaluate mid. If it's less than the target, the lower bound goes to mid, or else the upper bound goes to mid.\" That's a solid understanding of the overall approach but it isn't sufficient under further questioning. \"Do we include mid when narrowing the window?\" \"Which bound do we return?\" \"Do we evaluate mid <= target or mid < target?\" Answers to these questions are elusive unless you understand the exact semantics of the bounds, as well as what the situation specifically demands.\n",
