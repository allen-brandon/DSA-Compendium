    "Binary searches are notorious for off-by-1 errors and infinite loops. This is because there's a large contrast between the simplicity of the concept of a binary search, and the complications that arise in implementation. As seen in the above templates, there are multiple ways to structure a binary search, that are almost exactly the same as one another. For example, you could search for the lowest element >= x, or the highest element <= x. Many people encounter these issues and spend a consistent 10 or 15 minutes tweaking the code until finally they happen upon the correct implementation. Often this requires re-running the code over and over again, which can be detrimental in a large code-base (or in an interview!)\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't have to be this way. The key to not wasting time and effort finicking around with the code is to understand the semantics very specifically. A surface level understanding would be, \"evaluate mid. If it's less than the target, the lower bound goes to mid, or else the upper bound goes to mid.\" That's a solid understanding of the overall approach but it isn't sufficient under further scrutiny. \"Do we include mid when narrowing the window?\" \"Which bound do we return?\" \"Do we evaluate mid <= target or mid < target?\" Answers to these questions are elusive unless you understand the exact semantics of the bounds, as well as what the situation specifically demands.\n",

Similarly, we only want to decrease hi to mid if mid is a viable candidate for the upper bound. In practice, this could map to a few different things, depending on exactly what we want our ending two bounds to be. Are we looking for the first occurrence of the target value? In that case, lo should always increase to any number that's less than the target value, and hi should always decrease to any number that's greater than or equal to the target value.\n",

However the second is slightly preferable for venerated coders, purely for the reason that ` hi+lo ` can cause an integer overflow, whereas ` lo+(hi-lo)//2 ` never exceeds the average between the two.\n",

    "The last thing to look at is the predicate. We've discussed why the comparison would be <, or <=. But not all predicates look like this. For example, say we're playing a guessing game with someone. We can guess a number, and the other person tells us if it's greater than the number they're thinking of. This is almost the same scenario as binary searching through a sorted array, as is common with these applications, except that there's no array; only guessing individual numbers. Here, our predicate would not be ` if arr[mid] < target: `, but rather it would be ` if guess(mid): `.

The important quality is that, for any element in a given searchspace, if the predicate evaluates to false, all elements to one side of that will evaluate to false. And if that element's predicate evaluates to true, then all elements to the other side of that will evaluate to true. For example, say you're searching through a sorted array to find the index of a given value. If a given element is greater than the target value, its predicate will evaluate a certain way, and all elements greater than that value will evaluate the same way. So if it's too large, so will all elements larger than the element being tested. Likewise, if an element is smaller than the target value, so are all elements smaller than that.
