    "This code allows you to find all submasks of each bitmask from 0-2<sup>n</sup>, in O(3<sup>n</sup>). This is as opposed to a naive approach, which takes O(4<sup>n</sup>). Ordinarily, one would find every bitmask from 0-2<sup>n</sup>, and then have to iterate through all smaller masks (on the order of 0-2<sup>n</sup>) to find each submask. This equates to O(2<sup>n</sup> * 2<sup>n</sup>) = O(4<sup>n</sup>).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The way that this code operates in O(3<sup>n</sup>) time rather than O(4<sup>n</sup>) time is as follows: each bit can be in one of 3 states: It's not set (to 1) in the bitmask, it is set in the bitmask but not a given submask, or it's set in the bitmask and submask. Given that there are 3 states for each bit, iterating up through all n bits takes O(3<sup>n</sup>) time."
