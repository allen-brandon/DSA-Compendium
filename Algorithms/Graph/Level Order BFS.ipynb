    "Level Order Breath-First-Search algorithm uses a deque and a set. The reason we want a deque is because we want to have a FIFO, First in First out, because when we populate the deque with the valid neighbors of the cell we are at. The reason we have a set is because if we have seen a cell we dont want to go through the cell again. We also are going to hold another variable called depth which will be an int."

This alogrithm is very similar to [Breath First Search](https://github.com/allen-brandon/DSA-Compendium/blob/main/Algorithms/Graph/BFS.ipynb), the only difference is that Level Order Breath First Search takes into account the depth you are at in the graph wen Breath First search does not.\n",

If you see any thing to do with weights you want to either look at [Bellman-Ford's Algorithm](https://github.com/allen-brandon/DSA-Compendium/blob/main/Algorithms/Graph/Bellman-Ford.ipynb), [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://github.com/allen-brandon/DSA-Compendium/blob/main/Algorithms/Graph/Dijkstra.ipynb) or [A-Star Algorithm](https://github.com/allen-brandon/DSA-Compendium/blob/main/Algorithms/Graph/A-Star.ipynb)."
